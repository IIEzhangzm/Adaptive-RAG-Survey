# Adaptive-RAG-Survey

Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated revolutionary capabilities in both language understanding and generation. But they still face limitations, such as hallucinations (producing incorrect or non-sensical information) and reliance on outdated internal knowledge. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques have proven effective in integrating up-to-date information into LLMs, reducing hallucinations and improving response quality.However, it is not always appropriate to apply RAG in a fixed manner across all LLM application scenarios. Deciding when and how to use RAG remains an urgent challenge. In response to this challenge, a growing body of work has been proposed under the umbrella of \emph{Active/Adaptive/Dynamic RAG} collectively referred to as Adaptive RAG in this paper. This survey provides the first in-depth exploration of Active RAG, offering a detailed taxonomy of various methods, presenting existing datasets and task performance, and discussing the challenges and future opportunities in this emerging field.
